# TracerPredictor
**What it does**
  This application finds tracrRNA genes in a genome with previously annotated CDS. It does this by utilizing the fact that the anti-repeat part if a tracrRNA is approximately, but in almost all cases not exactly, the reverse complement of a CRISPR repeat starting with a conserved GYY motif, and the tail part of the tracrRNA (i.e. after the anti-repeat) often start with a conserved AR motif. Furthermore, known tracrRNAs often located within 500 bases from a cas9 gene, although there are exceptions. The application uses a support-vector machine to calculate the probability of a true-positive tracrRNA prediction based on the above-mentioned features, without requiring a full match.
